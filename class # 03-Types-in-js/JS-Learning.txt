Static vs Dynamic.

Types:
Number
Boolean
String
undefined
null
Symbol('just me)
{}

Javascript:
Everything is an object in js.

Sees!
Standard build-in objects.
JS comparison table.
Equality comparison and same

Arrays:
Arrays are object in js.

Primitive Types: Are immutable they cannot change them they are completely removed.
Non-Primitive Types:

By Refrenece vs By Value.
Object: Refrenec. Point same value. 
Primitive: Remove value. 

Type Coercion:
The Operands that is the things to the left 
and to the right of the Operator are different types.
Language convert certain type to another type.

Do all languages are type coercion?
Yes, In memory different types.
e.g Personal computer memory.


+0, -0

Dynamic vs Static type:
Type: 
Typescript (Superset of JS)
Less time debugging.

Weakly and strogly typed:  
JS, weakly typed Language.
Typescript: strongly typed language.

JTS_Static_Typing in JS.
1. Typescript (Microsoft)
2. flow (facebook)
3. RE (programming language Ocamel) by facebook.
4. ELM


flow --> (compiler (babel)) --> JS
Typescript --> (Typescript Compiler) --> JS 
ELM --> (ELM Compiler) --> JS 
RE --> (RE Compiler) --> JS
