<p>These next 3 videos are a little bit of "extra" from my other course, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/?referralCode=DF0142C1957FA18DE7EE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap</strong></a>. I have decided to include them on here because it will help you understand some interesting topics when it comes to types in Javascript. Enjoy!</p>
