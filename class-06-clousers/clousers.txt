Function Invoking:
In JS Functions Invoking two process.
1. this 
2. arguments

 Clousers
 function + lexical scope

 Lexical Scope:
 That is the javascript engine known based on where our 
 code is written before we even run the code.
 What variables each function has access to.

 Clousers allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environment, even after it
 leaves the scope in which it was declared
