<p>Have you heard of Babel or TypeScript? They are heavily used in the Javascript ecosystem and you should now have a good idea of what they are:<br><br><a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Babel</a> is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code).<br><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Typescript</a> is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript.<br><br>Both of these do exactly what compilers do: Take one language and convert into a different one!<br></p>
