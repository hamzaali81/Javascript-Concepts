<p>It has been brought to my attention that for some students the RapidAPI website doesn't work exactly as it does in the video. I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience. <br><br><strong><em>You don't need to follow along with the tasks on the RapidAPI website</em></strong>, it was intended as a guide to show how you'd choose an API you'd never used before and test it. <br><br><em>Please continue on and work on the project code</em>, <br><strong><em>the APIs will work in the code</em></strong>. <br><br>Hope you've been enjoying the course so far! </p>
