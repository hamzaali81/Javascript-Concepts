<p>In the previous video we saw that the CORS issue can be solved with something called a proxy server. Make sure you check out the resources attached to that lecture to learn more about this issue that comes up a lot when using free APIs.</p><p><br></p><p>For now, we have also provided a bonus video in the <strong>Appendix: CORS Issues</strong> section at the end of the course if you want to learn more about this and want to build your own custom Proxy Server. This is completely optional and won't add much to your understanding to the rest of the course so you can even save it for the very end of the course!<br><br></p>
