<p>The next 3 videos are going to build the exact same project as we have seen in previous lecture. These next 3 videos were part of the course originally, but because a lot of people were having issues with the API we have updated them to what you just watched. <br><br><strong>HOWEVER: </strong>We kept these next video on here to show you another way of building this project, and also what you should do when you encounter API&nbsp;errors like this which is very common in your day to day life as a developer. <br><br><strong>We will also do a Code Review at the very end which you have to watch since it applies to both versions of the project :)<br><br></strong>Optional lectures are marked with<strong> [OPTIONAL] </strong>tag. </p>
