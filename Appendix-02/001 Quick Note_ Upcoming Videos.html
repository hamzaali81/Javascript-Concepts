<p>These videos are are from my other course, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=FFF295AECF3594CE440E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web&nbsp;Developer in 2019:&nbsp;Zero to Mastery</strong></a>. I have decided to include them on here because it will help you understand some basic topics when it comes to JavaScript if you need a quick brush up on intermediate topics. </p>
