<p><strong>Async Await&nbsp;</strong>is an advanced feature of Javascript that is better learned after you have an understanding of asynchronous javascript. We cover these topics in the <strong>Asynchronous Javascript&nbsp;of the course</strong>. <br><br>There is also the new ES9 (ES2018) features that have come out which require a bit more asynchronous knowledge on our part so these new feature videos will be introduced in that same section as well. </p>
