1. Readable (Everyone understand)
2. Scalable (Performance)

BigO and Scalability:


Code Runtimes:
1. It depend on machine executing time. 
2. What type of PC.

1. Linear Time O(n):
Runtime is grow then increase number of inputs.
O(n) 

2. Constant Time O(1):
Number of operation is 1

1. Worst case.
2. Remove Constant.
