What is DS?
DS is a collection of values.

Algorithm:
Steps and allocation of DS.

What is Data Structure ?
Data Structure simple as file cabinet.
How to put the data in given
Block chain is simply a data Structure holds the data.
Programs modelling.
Readability Speed Space
e.g Bag , Box.

How Computers store data ?

Variable stores in ram that shows program run. In ram always lose data. Ram holds the data. Bit is tiny electrical switch.Each shelf has one byte of storage. 
Data on storage persistence is storage. Persistence storage is slow.
Computer run by cpu.
CPU acess ram and then storage. Cpu cache (cpu has tiny tiny memory) LRU cached



 Address(0)    00000001 ( 1 Bit = 8 byte)
 Address(1)    00000001
 Address(2)    00000001
 Address(3)    00000001
 Address(3)    00000001

8 bit 255
16 bit 65536
32 2,147,483,647

Data structure actually effect the process.

Opeartions on DS:
1. Insertion.
2. Deletion
3. Traversal (Access each data items exactly oneced can be processed)
4. Searching (findout the data item in a location).
5. Sorting: Data is sorted.
6. Access: How to we access the data.
