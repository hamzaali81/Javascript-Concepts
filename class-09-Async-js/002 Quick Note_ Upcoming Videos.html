<p>These next 5 videos are a little bit of "refresher" from my other course, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=FFF295AECF3594CE440E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery</strong></a>. I have decided to include them on here because it will help you understand some foundational topics when it comes to asynchronous javascript. The How JavaScript Works video will also help re establish what you learned in the first part of this course. <br><br>If you already feel confident with the material, you can skip over to <strong>Job Queue </strong>video!<br><br>Finally,<br></p><p>In the next few videos, I will be showing you how to use this: <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/</a><br><br>Sometimes, depending on incidents, the website may be down.
