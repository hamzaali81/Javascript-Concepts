What is functional programming, functional programming is all about
separation of concerns.
There's data and then this data gets interacted with.
But we are not going to combine both data and functions as one piece or one object.
Data and functions are concerns.
Don't have of classes and object concepts concern.
Instead, functions operate on well defined data structures like arrays and object, rather than actually.

Goals:
1. Clear + Understandable.
2. Easy to extend
3. Easy to Maintain
4. Memory Efficient
5. Dry

Separation data and behaviour of program.
functional programming pillars
1. Pure functions
